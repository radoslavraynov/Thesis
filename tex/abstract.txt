The main goal of this thesis is to develop a framework for both efficiently computing the image Y of a rational map φ : X −→ Pn, and studying the relation between algebraic properties of the coordinates φ j on one hand, and geometric properties of the image Y , on the other. We are most interested in the case when X is a smooth projective toric variety of dimension n − 1 and φ is generically finite, so finding the image entails computing a single equation P, the implicit equation. If S is the Cox ring of X, then the algebraic properties of the coordinates are captured by the ideal J = ⟨φ0,...,φn⟩ ⊂ S.
This is (a version of) the implicitization problem which is classical in algebraic geome- try. It has an effective solution through elimination using Gro ̈bner bases, for instance, but those techniques have two major drawbacks relative to our interests. First, they tend to be unfeasible for larger test cases. Second, they represent a black box in terms of geometry— it takes the φ j and returns P, whether or not this happens in our Sun’s lifetime. Motivated by the advance of computer aided design (CAD), interest in new approaches implicitization problem was reincarnated in the 1990s, with one of the initiating papers being Sederberg and Chen [1995].
Our approach follows the theme of moving surfaces but sets to remove the intrinsic reliance to ad-hoc and bring them to a more robust form, much like the approximation complex approach, initiated by Buse ́ and Jouanolou [2003]. We construct, for any de- gree d on S, a matrix N representing a generating set for the polynomial relations on the φ j with coefficients from Sd only. This construction generalized the types of representation matrices studied by the said methods and is rather immune to base locus, etc, which plague other methods. Moreover, such matrices can be computed incrementally using only meth- ods from linear algebra, allowing calculating for example which other methods simply could not.
