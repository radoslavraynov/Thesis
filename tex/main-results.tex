\begin{paragraf*}
We are now ready to state our main results.
While this chapter is supposed to be self-contained and most of the relevant notation
and definitions are listed in \eqref{par:again} below,
one should consult Chapter \ref{ch:prelim} for a more relaxed exposition
and further definitions, for instance,
for the notions of degree and multiplicity of a basepoint.

Examples \ref{ex203} and \ref{ex204} should serve as quick reference points.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{definition}
\label{par:again}
Let $X$ be a smooth projective toric variety of dimension $n-1$ ($n>1$)
with Cox ring $S$ and irrelevant ideal $\n\se S$.
Let $T=\CC[x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ and let
\[
\phi=(\phi_0,\ldots,\phi_n):X\To\PP^n=\Proj(T)
\]
be a rational map given by linearly independent sections of the line bundle $\O_X(\mathbf p)$
for some degree $\mathbf p$ on $S$.
Let $J=\la \phi_0,\ldots,\phi_n\ra\se S$ be ideal of the coordinate functions of $\phi$.

Let $\d$ be a degree on $S$ such that $r=\dim_\CC(S_\d)>0$ and let $I\se R=S\tensor T$ be the
Rees ideal of $J$. Let $I_{\d,\bullet}$ be its degree-$\d$ bigraded piece,
considered as a finite graded $T$-module.
We denote by $B=R/I$ the Rees algebra of $J$.

Let $N$ be the $r\times\mu$ matrix of a minimal set of homogeneous generators for $I_{\d,\bullet}$
and let $N_i$ be the submatrix of $N$ corresponding to generators of degree $i$, that is,
\[
N=(~N_1~|\ldots|~N_\delta~)
\]
\end{definition}

\begin{definition}
\label{par:conds}
Let $P\se T$ be the prime ideal corresponding to the closed image of $\phi$ in $\PP^n$.
We denote this image by $Y=V(P)$.
Let $Z=V(J)\se X$ be the base locus of $\phi$.

We are going to be interested the following three conditions:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item\label{itm:conds:1} The map $\phi$ is generically finite onto its image, that is,
	$Y\se\PP^n$ is of codimension $1$ and in particular, the ideal $P$ is principal.
	In this case, we denote a generator of $P$ by $P(\mathbf x)$.
	\item\label{itm:conds:2} The base locus $Z$ is $0$-dimensional, that is,
	consists of finitely many points.
	Note that those are necessarily closed over $\CC$ but this is not needed for our results.
	\item\label{itm:conds:3} The map $\phi$ is birational.
\end{enumerate}

Clearly, either of \eqref{itm:conds:2} and \eqref{itm:conds:3} implies \eqref{itm:conds:1}.
\end{definition}

\begin{paragraf*}
We begin by making a few easy but important observations about the Rees ideal.
These are needed later.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:BP}~
\begin{enumerate}[label=\normalfont(\alph*)]
\item
The ideal $I\se R$ is prime, and so is $I_P$ in the $T$-module localization $R_P$.
\item
The quotient $B_P$ is naturally a finite-type graded $K(T/P)$-algebra
with grading induced by $S$.
\item\label{itm:BPKTP-alg}
The $K(T/P)$-algebra $B_P$ is a homogeneous coordinate ring of a
projective variety.
\end{enumerate}
\end{proposition}

\begin{paragraf}
\label{par:reg-BP}
By part \ref{itm:BPKTP-alg} of Proposition \ref{prop:BP}, $\Proj(B_P)$ becomes a toric
projective variety.
Following either [Greg Smith and Maclagan] or [Hoffman and Wang],
we can define its regularity, denoted $\reg(B_P)$.
It is similar to the Castenlnuovo-Mumford regularity over $\PP^n$ in sense that
$\reg(B_P)$ is a finitely generated additively-closed subset of the semigroup of degrees on $S$,
and for any $\d\in\reg(B_P)$, the scheme structure of $V(I_P)$ is already reflected in degree $\d$.
\end{paragraf}

\begin{paragraf*}
In light of Proposition \ref{prop:BP}, our first result becomes an easy exercise.
However, it a step toward the goal of this paper---to exhibit a general relation between
the algebra of the coordinates $\phi_j$ and the geometry of the image $Y$.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rad-minors}
In the setup of \eqref{par:again}, one has
\[
\rad(\mt{minors}(r,N))=P
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{paragraf*}
The geometric interpetation of the theorem is clear ---
the nonzero minors of $N$ define hypersurfaces in $\PP^n$ whose intersection,
at least set-theoretically, is the image $Y$.

Example [the twisted-cubic], for instance, shows that the radical is necessary.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{paragraf*}
Our next result is the main theorem of this thesis, unifying two currently
popular non-Gr\"{o}bner bases approaches to implicitization and setting the stage for both
the ad-hoc template proofs in Chapter \ref{ch:koszul-bpf} and
the fast implicitization method described in Chapter \ref{ch:fast-method}.

We point out that the following theorem is neither a stronger nor a weaker version
of Theorem \ref{thm:rad-minors} but rather a specialization along the lines of [Buse-Juonolou].
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:gcd-minors}
Consider the setup of \eqref{par:again} and assume \itmref{itm:conds:1}{par:conds}.
Fix a degree $\mathbf d\in\reg(B_P)$ as described in \eqref{par:reg-BP}.
One has
\[
\gcd(\mt{minors}(r, N))=P^{\deg\phi}
\]
In particular, if there is a degree $\mathbf d$ in the regularity for which $\mu=r$,
then $N$ is square and, up to a unit,
\[
\det(N)=P(\mathbf x)^{\deg\phi}
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{corollary}
\label{thm:detM}
In the setup of Theorem \ref{thm:gcd-minors},
let $M$ be any $r\times r$ matrix of syzygies over $S_\d$. One has
\[
	\det(M)=P(\mathbf x)^{\deg\phi}\cdot H(\mathbf x)
\]
for a homogeneous $H(\mathbf x)$ of degree
\begin{align}
\label{eq:degree-offset}
\deg\det(M)-\deg(\phi)\cdot\deg(Y)
\end{align}

Furthermore, there exist a list of such matrices $\{M_k\}$ such that
the corresponding $H_k(\mathbf x)$ are nonzero and without a common factor.
\end{corollary}

\begin{paragraf*}
Geometrically, the former is a refinement of Theorem \ref{thm:rad-minors}.
Each of the maximal minors of $N$, in fact
the determinant of any $r\times r$ matrix $M$ of syzygies over $S_\d$, is either $0$
or describes in $\PP^n$ the union of a $\deg(\phi)$-fold $Y$ and
a hypersurface of degree \eqref{eq:degree-offset}.
While an arbitrary collection $M_k$ of such matrices may introduce hypersurfaces
with an intersection that is strictly larger than $Y$,
the maximal minors suffice to shave off any extraneous components.

The theme of extraneous factors is already apparent in \citet{BCJ09} and \citet{Botbol2011}
who use the approximation complex to show that, in our running notation, for a toric $X$,
certain $\d$ and almost complete intersection baselocus $Z$,
\[
	\gcd(\minors(r,N_1))=P^{\deg\phi}\cdot\prod_{p\in Z} L_p(\mathbf x)^{e_p-d_p}
\]
where each $L_p(\mathbf x)$ is a linear form.

In the case of complete intersection baselocus, the proof of Theorem \ref{thm:gcd-minors}
gives a special case of the above.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{corollary}[Buse-Jouanoulo]
\label{cor:approx-complex}
In the setup of Theorem \ref{thm:gcd-minors}, let $\d$ be {\em large enough} in the semigroup
of degrees on $S$.
Recall that $N_1$ is the matrix of linear syzygies.
If $\Proj(B)$ is isomorphic to $\Proj(\Sym(J))$ in the sense of [equation from before], then
\[
	\gcd(\mt{minors}(r, N_1))=P^{\deg\phi}
\]

In particular, the result holds if the baselocus is $0$-dimensional and locally a complete intersection.
\end{corollary}

\begin{paragraf*}
It is a know fact that if $M$ is a square matrix over $T$ of size $r$,
then the singular locus of $V(\det(M))$ is contained in the closed subset defined by the
comaximal minors, that is, the $(r-1)$-minors.
Although we failed to find a reference for the aforementioned result,
we believe that this relation is more intrinsic and holds for all matrices $N$.
Examples [at least 2-3 examples] explore this further.
Specifically, we conjecture the following
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{conjecture}
\label{conj:sing-locus}
Let $\phi$ be birational and $\d$ be any degree on $S$. One has
\[
V(\minors(r-1,N))\se\mathrm{Sing}(Y)
\]
\end{conjecture}



\begin{paragraf*}
In the simplest cases of interest, when $X=\PP^2$ or $X=\PPP$ and $\phi$ is basepoint-free,
we can chose $\d$ so that the matrix $N$ becomes square.
Next two theorems are slight generalizations of the results in \citet{00-CGZ-JSC}.
More importantly, they show that our methods directly generalize the methods of
moving planes and quadrics in the setting in which they are most useful.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rel-moving-planes-quadrics}
Let $X=\PP^2$, $\phi$ be basepoint-free,
and suppose that there are exactly $p=\mathbf e$ linear syzyges over degree $\d=p-1$,
that is, the minimal possible number.
Then one has that $N=(N_1~|~N_2)$, $N$ is square and $\phi$ is birational.
In particular,
\[
\det(N)=\det(N_1~|~N_2)=P(\mathbf x)
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{theorem}
\label{thm:rel-moving-quadrics}
Let $X=\PP^1\times\PP^1$, $\phi$ be basepoint-free with coordinates in degree $\mathbf e=(p,q)$,
and suppose there are no linear syzyges over degree $\d=(p-1,q-1)$.
Then one has that $N_2$ is square, $N=N_2$ and $\phi$ is birational. In particular,
\[
	\det(N)=\det(N_2)=P(\mathbf x)
\]
\end{theorem}

\begin{paragraf*}
Both of these theorems are examples of a template proof decribed in Chapter \ref{ch:koszul-bpf}.
While applying it in general requires elaborate choses of the degree $\d$ and
regularity computations, in the case of basepoint-free maps we only used a type
of Koszul-ness on the syzygies of low degree.
This is the content of Theorem [reference the theorem in Chapter 7]
\end{paragraf*}



\begin{paragraf*}
We conclude this list by a method to compute the degree of a rational map using Gr\"{o}bner bases.
While we are only going to use this in our examples,
it helps expand our understanding about the object $B_P$.

The author wants to thank Mike Stillman for suggesting it.
\end{paragraf*}

\begin{proposition}
\label{prop:deg-GB}
Let $\CC[s_0,\ldots,s_m]$ be the fixed ambient polynomial ring of $S'$ as described in \ref{par:setup}.
Define the ideal $I_B$ of $\CC[s_0,\ldots,s_m;x_0,\ldots,x_n]$ by the equality
\[
	B=\CC[\mathbf s;\mathbf x]/I_B
\]
Let $>'$ be any product order in which the $\mathbf s$ variables
come before the $\mathbf x$ variables.
Then a reduced Gr\"obner basis for $I_B$ with respect to $>'$ has the form
\begin{align*}
	&g_1(\mathbf s;\mathbf x)=p_1(\mathbf x){\mathbf s}^{\alpha_1}+\text{lower order terms}\\
	&\qquad\cdots\\
	&g_r(\mathbf s;\mathbf x)=p_r(\mathbf x){\mathbf s}^{\alpha_r}+\text{lower order terms}\\
	&g_{r+1}(\mathbf s;\mathbf x)=P(\mathbf x)
\end{align*}
and
\[
	\deg(\phi)=\deg \big(\la{\mathbf s}^{\alpha_1},\ldots,{\mathbf s}^{\alpha_r}\ra\se\CC[\mathbf s]\big)
\]
\end{proposition}

% \begin{paragraf*}
% Next, we present an example with two surprising features.
% First, it shows what the general map of some fixed degree and base locus looks like,
% and how this is related to the geometry of its image.
% Second, this will be an example of a map whose image is the determinant of a matrix
% of linear forms, yet not one build from syzygies.
% It foreshadows the results in Chapter \ref{ch:bicubics} and highlights the close
% relation of $N$ to $S$, not just $Y$.
% See Example \ref{ex311} for a concrete calculation and the examples in Chapter \ref{ch:examples}
% for a further discussion.
% \end{paragraf*}
%
% \begin{conjecture}
% \label{conj:nice-example}
% Let $X=\PPP$ and $\phi$ be a general map among the maps be given by four bicubics with
% a common zero locus the single point $(0,1)\times(0,1)$ of degree $3$ and multiplicity $4$.
% Then $\phi$ is generically 1-1, the image $Y$ is of degree $4$ and is singular along
% three non-degenerate concurent lines.
% Further, $Y$ is defined by the determinant of a $4\times4$-matrix of linear forms.
% \end{conjecture}
